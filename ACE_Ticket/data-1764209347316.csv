Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

First step: Contact Frances to confirm the details of the Scissor lift PU that requires correction.

Second step: Coordinate with the Joliet团队 to review the current configuration in the WMS system.

Third step: Verify the ISA ID associated with the Scissor lift PU in the EDI system.

Fourth step: Reach out to Anthony to ensure the API settings are correctly aligned with the CubeShip requirements.

Fifth step: Collaborate with Jeff from B-Solutions to double-check the PO号码 and make necessary adjustments.

Sixth step: Inform Eaden about the changes made and request a final review.

Seventh step: Estimate the time required for the entire process and communicate it to the relevant stakeholders.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
